# Slidey

Slidey was developed to give me a deeper understanding of CSS3 animations and pseudo-classes. The challenge was to create all the
logic using just HTML5 and CSS3.

A browser supporting modern features such as CSS3 animations is required to properly view this slide show. The latest versions of [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome), [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.firefox.com/) or [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) are recommended for the best experience.
